# TEASEL: A Transformer-based Speech-Prefixed Language Model

This is an implemention of [TEASEL: A Transformer-based Speech-Prefixed Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05522.pdf). We have listed below the steps to reproduce the experiments. Our model files are downloadable [here]() and the results closely match those published in the paper. We are not the original authors, but are open to discuss any issue with code or paper's understanding. 

## Installation

Please check that you have all the requirements in sync with the requirements.txt file, alteranatively you could execute the command below:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We have not tested the code to work on other versions, especially for the transformers and pytorch libraries.

## Pretraining

For the pretraining phase, please download librispeech dataset ({train/test/dev}-clean-100 version).
